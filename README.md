All programming problems demand not only solving them but solving them in a beautiful way!<br/>
And especially with this problem, the challenge is not so much to solve it but to solve it in a beautiful way.<br/>
So, the sorting is done in the same loop that transforms the array, with simple, uncomplicated operations.<br/>
And in programming, in many cases, distilling the tasks to simple, expressive, operations is the hardest thing to do!
